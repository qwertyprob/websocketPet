# Pet Project: Issue Reporting & Admin Chat

This is a personal project for reporting issues, managing requests, and real-time admin communication. Users can submit problems with descriptions and files, while an admin can view all issues and chat with users in real-time.

## Features

### User

- **Report an Issue**: Submit a problem with a description and attach files.
- **View My Requests**: See all your submitted issues in a DataTable.
- **File Attachments**: Upload multiple files per issue for better context.

### Admin

- **View All Issues**: Access all user-submitted issues with full details.
- **Download Files**: Download any files attached by users.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Communicate with users through WebSocket messaging.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket
- **Database / Storage**

## How It Works

2. The issue appears in the DataTable of submitted requests.
